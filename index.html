<p>At first glance the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/impact/">impact</a>
of <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/pre-lecture/">pre-lecture</a>, <a
href="{{ site.baseurl }}/lecture/">lecture</a> and <a href="{{
site.baseurl }}/post-lecture/">post-lecture</a> material might not be
obvious.  However, the <a href="{{ site.baseurl
}}/impact/#hake-gain">Hake Gain</a> shows <a href="{{ site.baseurl
}}/impact/#measurable-improvement">measurable improvement</a> of
student comprehension and retention.  In just one year, learning more
than doubled!</p>

<p>Over three years, I devised and implemented a course with active
learning tutorials, based on Physics Education Research (PER).  I
provided students with <a href="{{ site.baseurl
}}/pre-lecture/#lecture-notes">lecture notes</a> and <a href="{{
site.baseurl }}/pre-lecture/#pre-lecture-video">pre-lecture
videos</a>.  I created tightly-integrated <a href="{{ site.baseurl
}}/post-lecture/#tutorial">tutorial</a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl
}}/post-lecture/#homework">homework</a> and <a href="{{ site.baseurl
}}/post-lecture/#test">test</a> questions.  This teaching portfolio
provides examples.</p>

<p>Instruction covers factual, conceptual and procedural knowledge.
Factual knowledge: light travels at
<var>3&times;10<sup>8</sup></var>&nbsp;m/s in a vacuum.  Conceptual
knowledge: unbalanced forces cause acceleration.  Procedural
knowledge: step-by-step instructions for graphical addition of
vectors.  Pre-lecture videos provide factual and conceptual knowledge.
Tutorials focus on actively utilizing procedural knowledge. Lectures
are the bridge.  Consistent with PER, instruction favors
procedural knowledge over factual knowledge.</p></p>

<p>I designed a strategy to incorporate five suggestions from a review
of PER literature.  First, tutorials and pre-lecture videos <em>keep
students actively engaged</em> by asking frequent questions, with
rapid feedback. Second, lectures and pre-lecture videos <em>work from
concrete to abstract</em>, putting observation and description of
physical phenomena ahead of theories and formul&aelig;.  Third, lectures
take time to <em>debunk common fallacies</em> before setting the
record straight&nbsp;&mdash; like removing tooth decay to make way for a
filling.  Fourth, lectures and tutorials <em>teach explicit algorithms
for solving problems</em>, starting with a sketch and ending with
checks on solution validity.  Fifth, tests and <em>graded exercises
include procedural knowledge</em>, not just conceptual and factual
knowledge.</p>
