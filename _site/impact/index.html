<h1>Zajac Teaching Portfolio</h1>
<h2 id="impact">Impact</h2>
<p>From an <a href="/">overview</a>, the merit
of <a href="/pre-lecture/">pre-lecture</a>, <a href="/lecture/">lecture</a> and <a href="/post-lecture/">post-lecture</a> material might not be obvious.
However, the <a href="#hake-gain">Hake Gain</a> shows <a
href="#measurable-improvement">measurable improvement</a> of student
comprehension and retention of basic physical principles.</p>

<h3 id="hake-gain">Hake Gain</h3>

<p>To quantify student learning, the Hake Gain compares student
results on identical pre- and post-course surveys. Suppose that
<var>B</var> and <var>A</var> are mean student scores before and after
instruction, respectively; the Hake Gain is defined as <var>H =
(A-B)/(M-B)</var>, where <var>M</var> is the maximum possible score.
Note that students who start and end with high scores show little gain
so, results are not skewed by students with prior understanding.  From
previous studies, a Hake Gain of <var>0.52 &plusmn; 0.10</var> is possible
with an active learning approach, compared to <var>0.22 &plusmn; 0.05</var>
for traditional didactic lectures</p>

<h3 id="measurable-improvement">Measurable Improvement</h3>

<p>As seen in a <a href="#hake-gain-histogram">histogram</a>, the
modal Hake Gain for my students climbed steadily for three successive
years. In the first year of active learning (2015) my students
achieved a Hake Gain of <var>0.26 &plusmn; 0.02</var> compared to
<var>0.10 &plusmn; 0.02</var> when I gave traditional didactic
lectures the previous year (2014).  In just one year, learning more
than doubled!</p>

<figcaption>The modal Hake Gain for my students started at zero, for
traditional didactic lectures (2015), but rose to <var>0.4</var> in
two years (2016, 2017), once instruction switched to active
learning.</figcaption>
